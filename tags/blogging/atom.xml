        <content type="html" xml:base="/blog/hello-blog/">&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve almost never written on the internet.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
My social media accounts are clinically dead. On Reddit and the few forums that I follow I&#x27;m mainly a lurker.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
So why start a blog?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m not entirely sure why.
Maybe it&#x27;s some kind of reaction to the enshittification of the internet. Socials sucks in a way that is almost hurting: The dynamics they promote suck; the owners are all tied for first in the contest of who sucks more; the algorithms keep promoting stuff that really sucks.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Communities, especially niche ones, have mostly migrated from forums and webrings to closed, non-searchable Discord servers. Where once there were long and useful posts now is reactions, memes and one liners.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I don&#x27;t even want to start complaining about the tech. Who am I kidding? I&#x27;m dying to - but it&#x27;s probably going to be a post on it&#x27;s own.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, this sounds like a &quot;back in my day&quot; rant, and it fundamentally is.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I had the luck to be a 9 year old kid with unsupervised and mostly unlimited access to the internet. I loved that internet. In those gloriously ugly Geocites and Altervista pages or in even more uglier Forumfree communities I discovered a world of interests, hobbies and worldviews that I would never have been exposed to otherwise.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I am, couple of decades later, trying to do my part in keeping alive that kind of internet.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Dead simple tech for simply showing words in someone&#x27;s browser. Almost no Javascript and a couple of CSS rules - I was almost tempted to go &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;motherfuckingwebsite.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;all-in&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on that, but &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeberg.org&#x2F;alanpearce&#x2F;zola-bearblog&quot;&gt;this Zola theme&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a lovely compromise - in service of a space for my thoughts, rants and hobbies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
