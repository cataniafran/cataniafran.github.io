I've almost never written on the internet.  
My social media accounts are clinically dead. On Reddit and the few forums that I follow I'm mainly a lurker.  
So why start a blog?

I'm not entirely sure why.
Maybe it's some kind of reaction to the enshittification of the internet. Socials sucks in a way that is almost hurting: The dynamics they promote suck; the owners are all tied for first in the contest of who sucks more; the algorithms keep promoting stuff that really sucks.  
Communities, especially niche ones, have mostly migrated from forums and webrings to closed, non-searchable Discord servers. Where once there were long and useful posts now is reactions, memes and one liners.  
I don't even want to start complaining about the tech. Who am I kidding? I'm dying to - but it's probably going to be a post on it's own.

I know, this sounds like a "back in my day" rant, and it fundamentally is.  
I had the luck to be a 9 year old kid with unsupervised and mostly unlimited access to the internet. I loved that internet. In those gloriously ugly Geocites and Altervista pages or in even more uglier Forumfree communities I discovered a world of interests, hobbies and worldviews that I would never have been exposed to otherwise.  

So here I am, couple of decades later, trying to do my part in keeping alive that kind of internet.  
Dead simple tech for simply showing words in someone's browser. Almost no Javascript and a couple of CSS rules - I was almost tempted to go [all-in](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) on that, but [this Zola theme](https://codeberg.org/alanpearce/zola-bearblog) is a lovely compromise - in service of a space for my thoughts, rants and hobbies.
