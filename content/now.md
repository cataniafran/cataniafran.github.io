### Still working at QubicaAMF
After a year working on the [Neoverse](https://www.qubicaamf.com/bowling-products/entertainment-systems/neoverse) product team, I'm back on Team Payments.  
In the coming months I'll continue working on our new micro-frontend architecture.

### Messing with Rails
I wanted to see what all the fuss around Ruby on Rails was about.  
I'm building a toy application - some kind of polling or friendly-stupid-bets website.  
I love the no-JS-build approach, testing tools and general philosophy. Not entirely sold on Ruby as a language.

### Planning a trip to Japan
My girlfriend and I are still committed to a "YOLO - at least one new country visited per year" plan and, if the Skyscanner gods are favorable, it will be Japan next December.

### Third year of ~~D&D~~ OSE sandbox campaign
Against all odds I'm still refereeing a d&d campaign. What started as a "let's try some simple dungeon crawling" has turned into a multi-year campaign in pseudo-9th-century Europe. Loving it.

### No HEMA this year
Thanks to a shoulder injury last July, this will *not* be my 4th year as a HEMA practitioner. I hope to be back swinging swords in the next few months.
